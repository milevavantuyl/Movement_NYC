# Melanie Time Series Analysis
These notebooks describe how the traffic data changes over time.
- August 2014 Pandas: these are smaller examples of the types of analyses I needed to do.
- Templates: examples of how to read in the data.
See the notebooks in this directory for examples of my analyses using PySpark.
